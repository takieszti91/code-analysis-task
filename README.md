# Code Analysis Task
This project serves as a solution to a professional test. I created it to demonstrate my technical skills and expertise. The original task description is provided below.
## Part 2: Low-Level Code Analysis
Task: Analyze and refactor the given Java code.
Example Code:
```
package org.interview;

public class MysteryFunction {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] data = {12, 4, 6, 9, 2};
        for (int i = 0; i < data.length; i++){
            data[i] = transform(data[i]);
        }
        for (int value : data) {
            System.out.println(value);
        }
    }

    private static int transform(int input){
        int result = 0;
        while (input > 0) {
            result += (input % 10) * (input % 10);
            input /= 10;
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```

Instructions:
- Explain what the ```transform``` method is doing.
- Identify any potential issues or inefficiencies.
- Refactor the code for better clarify and efficiency.

## Explanation of the code
The program first initializes an array of integers. It then iterates through the elements of this array, applying the ```transform()``` method to each number and replacing the current value in the array with the method's return value. Afterward, the program iterates through the array once more and prints the values of its elements.

The ```transform()``` method takes an integer as input (stored in the variable ```input```). First, the function defines the variable ```result``` and initializes it to 0. For the loop to execute at least once, the original value of ```input``` must be greater than 0. Then, it computes the remainder of the ```input``` number when divided by 10, squares this remainder, and adds it to ```result``` (which initially holds the value 0). Next, the ```input``` variable is divided by 10 (since it is an integer, this effectively removes the last digit). The new value of ```input``` becomes this truncated number. If the new value is greater than 0 (meaning the previous ```input``` contained at least one full multiple of 10), the loop repeats. Once the loop terminates, the function returns ```result```, which is the sum of the squares of the remainders when dividing by 10.

## Issues and inefficiencies
- The code should use clear and descriptive names to improve readability.
- The ```main()``` method unnecessarily iterates through the array twice and also overwrites the original values, even though the sole purpose here is to print the new values. Since these values are not used elsewhere, the same functionality can be achieved by iterating through the array only once and printing the new values without storing them.
- The remainder when dividing by 10 is calculated twice, but it could be stored in a variable to avoid repeating the calculation. For large numbers, both modulus and division operations are inefficient, which is another reason to store the remainder in a variable.
- The code does not handle negative numbers.
- When iterating over an array, it is simpler to use the ```for (int value : data) {}``` format instead of ```for (int i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {}```.

## Refactoring and improvements
You can find my refactored and improved solution in ```Calculation.java```.
